    <p>
        We are a team of students, researchers and developers based at the <b>AGH University of Krakow</b> in Poland.
        Our activities concern open-source software for
          atmospheric sciences, and <b>cloud physics</b> in particular.
        We develop open, example-rich tools to support reproducible computational research, 
          while promoting best practices in <b>research software engineering</b>.
        Our team contributes to the open-source ecosystem we rely on.
        We explore modern, transferable technologies that are useful both within and beyond academia.
        Most of the projects we develop, maintain and contribute to are hosted at 
          <a href="https://github.com/open-atmos">github.com/open-atmos</a>,
          hence the <b>open-atmos-krk</b> name.
