## Polish edition of the Rogers & Yau "<em>Short course on cloud physics</em>"

Our flagship outreach project! 
<a href="https://wuj.pl/ksiazka/zarys-fizyki-chmur">Published in 2023 and available in bookstores and online (as both an e-book and a hard copy)</a>.
The first and, so far, the only book devoted exclusively to cloud physics published in the Polish language. 

Kudos to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rafal-korycinski-15116027/">Rafał Koryciński</a>
  for his excellent work translating the book into Polish,
  to <a href="https://matuszko.wordpress.com/">Dorota Matuszko</a> 
  for her editorial guidance and for connecting us with <a href="https://wuj.pl/">Jagiellonian University Press</a>,
  which handled all legal, practical and technical matters superbly, and to
  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marta-jaszczuk-8594b0178/">Marta Jaszczuk</a> her sleek cover design, which we greatly appreciate.
The entire book was typeset in
